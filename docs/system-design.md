## How to Approach System Design Questions (Especially in Interviews):

- *Clarification is Key*: Before jumping into a solution, ask clarifying questions to understand the requirements, scope, scale (number of users, operations), read/write ratios, and specific functionalities.
    
- *Break Down the Problem*: Divide the system into smaller, manageable components like databases, APIs, and caching mechanisms.
    
- *Define Scope*: Determine what to include and exclude in your design.
    
- *Prioritize Requirements*: Focus on the critical components first.

- *Understand Functional and Non-Functional Requirements*: Clearly identify what the system should do and its quality attributes (scalability, reliability, latency, etc.).

- *Discuss Trade-offs*: Compare different design solutions and justify your choices, explaining the pros and cons of each.

- *Use Visuals*: Employ diagrams to illustrate the system architecture and workflows.

- *Communicate Your Thought Process*: Clearly articulate your reasoning and the steps you're taking to arrive at your design.

- *Consider Core Concepts*: Demonstrate understanding of distributed systems, fault tolerance, high availability, microservices architecture, and API design principles (REST, GraphQL).


- *Think about Data Storage*: Discuss database choices (SQL vs. NoSQL), sharding strategies, and indexing.

- *Address Scalability*: Explain how your design would handle increasing user loads (horizontal scaling, load balancing).

- *Incorporate Caching*: Explain how caching can optimize read performance and reduce latency.
